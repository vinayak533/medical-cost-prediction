# 🏥 Medical Cost Prediction

This project predicts **medical insurance costs** using machine learning models.  
It explores how demographic and health-related factors such as **age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children** affect medical expenses.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about individuals and their corresponding insurance charges.  
Key features include:
- **Age**: Age of the individual
- **Sex**: Male/Female
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Children**: Number of dependents
- **Smoker**: Smoking status
- **Region**: Residential area
- **Charges**: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## 🛠️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing medical charges distribution
   - Correlation analysis
   - Impact of smoking, age, and BMI on charges

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split
   - Regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Evaluation using RMSE & R² Score

4. **Results**
   - Best performing model identified
   - Insights on key cost-driving factors
